***Unfortunately I currently do not have the time to work on this, and I personally recommend you use the [Cider](https://cider.sh/) Apple Music client as it includes Discord Rich Presence and also has a beautiful UI and tons of amazing features (and it lacks the quirky bugs this project has :P, also im not affiliated with Cider I just appreciate the teams work and I use the app myself)***

## Highlights

- Easy to use
- Fetches and displays album artwork from iTunes (This even works for local songs, as long as they're on iTunes and have the right metadata)
- Shows time elapsed (How far into the song you are)
- Status disappears after music is paused for >10 minutes and when no music is playing
- [Configurable/Customizable](https://github.com/wxllow/applemusicrp/wiki/Configuration)
- Universal Application (on macOS)

## Download

### macOS

If you have homebrew installed, you can use this command to install AppleMusicRP:

`brew install --no-quarantine wxllow/based/applemusicrp`

Otherwise, you can just download the latest DMG from the [releases](https://github.com/wxllow/applemusicrp/releases) tab

### Windows

The latest version is available from the [releases](https://github.com/wxllow/applemusicrp/releases) tab

## Usage

Make sure Discord is running and open the app!

***If you get an "Unidentified Developer" error, option+click the application and then click Open***

## Building

***macOS: If you want to build a universal application, make sure you are using [Python 3 universal2 from Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) and not the homebrew version of Python!***

***Windows: Make sure you're using Python from the Python website and not from the Microsoft Store!***

`poetry install` (If you don't have poetry, install it using `pip install poetry`)

### macOS

`poetry run briefcase build`

`poetry run briefcase package --adhoc-sign`

Outputs to : `macOS/AppleMusicRP-*.dmg`

### Windows

`poetry run python setup_win.py py2exe`

Outputs to: `dist\windows`

## Notes (for devs)

- AppleMusicRP uses two libraries for the system tray: pystray for Windows and rumps for macOS. Even though pystray is cross-platform, using it led to issues with compatibility and universal apps (see https://github.com/wxllow/applemusicrp/issues/21 and https://github.com/wxllow/applemusicrp/issues/20)
